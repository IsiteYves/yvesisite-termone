# BE & FE Testing | How to run these apps
Simple Calculator Testing BE &amp; FE

### Guideline on how to run this system
<p>Here, I have two folders in the repo, one for Frontend (built in React) and another for Backend(built in Springboot). You can see the folders as indicated by their names</p>

<h3>You can clone the repo and navigate to each folder independently to run it:</h3>

```
cd calc-frontend
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

Run `npm start` to run the app
Run `npm test` to run tests for the React app
